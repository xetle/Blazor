# Blazor Web Site

This is the C# code repository for a Blazor webite hosted in AWS at http://xetle.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ 
Blazor is a Microsoft technology.
The advantage of using Blazor (for me) is that I can use C# to code client side functionality - rather than javascript which I am less familiar with.
The Blazor site is a solely client side application (or WebAssembly) i.e. there is no web server - the files are stored in an Amazon Cloud S3 bucket.
